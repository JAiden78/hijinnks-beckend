Cosmopolitan _2.jpg,Duran Duran,"At the dawn of the 1980s, a group of young men in Birmingham, England had a sound in their ears - one with echoes of glam, art-pop and dance. The band they formed quickly became a household name and, four decades later, Duran Duran has sold more than 100 million records, had 18 American hit singles, 20 UK Top 20 tunes and continues to perform to huge concert audiences around the world.More remarkable still is the way the band _ singer Simon Le Bon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes, bassist John Taylor and drummer Roger Taylor _ has achieved this: by fusing pop music, art, technology, and fashion with a sense of style and confidence all its own. Never losing the desire to innovate, the band has proven itself timeless and always ahead of the curve.Duran Duran's most recent album, Paper Gods, is the band_s highest-charting release in 22 years and has been hailed by critics and fans alike as their best body of work in two decades. Produced by Grammy award-winners Mark Ronson and Nile Rodgers, alongside Mr Hudson and Josh Blair, Paper Gods features collaborations with Janelle Mon†e, John Frusciante, Kiesza and Jonas Bjerre (of Mew).",Live music,8:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,22.02.2019,22.02.2019,No,"3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.110160-115.174040,https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/entertainment/events/duran-duran,702 698 6797

Cosmopolitan _3.jpg,Metric & Zoe,"METRICToronto rockers Metric emphasize guitars on the band_s latest album Art of Doubt, a collection of 12 new songs packed with massive riffs, driving rhythm and raw/smooth vocals that have become their instantly identifiable signature sound. Produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen (M83, Beck, Nine Inch Nails), Metric_s seventh LP addresses a climate of cultural and political anxiety while refusing to give despair the upper hand. In many ways, it_s the most Metric album the band has ever made as Emily Haines, Jimmy Shaw, Joshua Winstead and Joules Scott-Key rediscover their shared love of music and how good they are at making it together.ZOêWith a career that spans more than 20 years, Mexican rock band ZoÇ has released five studio albums, two live albums, an MTV Unplugged episode, as well as special releases with remixes and new versions, EPs and compilations of their greatest hits. To date, more than 3 million fans have seen ZoÇ live and the group has sold more than 1.5 million records, earning several Gold and Platinum albums, plus a Diamond and Triple Platinum record by MTV Unplugged Background Music.JULY TALKIn October of 2012, Canadian alternative rock band July Talk_s self-titled, independently released debut album had become a staple on modern-rock radio, earning the band a gold record in Canada and a JUNO Award for Alternative Album of the Year, while worldwide deals with Island, Polydor and Universal had spread the good word overseas. On Touch, July Talk_s second album, human connection becomes a full-contact sport: Peter Dreimanis and fellow guitarist Ian Docherty power songs like _Ask You_ and _Johnny + Mary_ (not a cover of the namesake Robert Palmer classic) with punked-up aggression, while the glam-rock stomp of _Beck + Call_ (featuring guest growls from throat-singing phenom Tanya Tagaq) showcases the wrecking-ball swing of bassist Josh Warburton and drummer Danny Miles. Produced by Ian Davenport, Touch has gone on to win the 2017 JUNO Award for Alternative Album of the Year, earn two No. 1 singles at radio with _Push + Pull_ and _Picturing Love,_ and sell out a cross-Canadian tour.",Live music,6:30:00 PM,10:00:00 PM,10.03.2019,10.03.2019,No,"3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.110160-115.174040,https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/entertainment/events/metric-and-zoe,702 698 6797
Cosmopolitan _4.jpg,Flogging Molly,"The social and political awareness that drives Flogging Molly's music is never more prominent than in their 2017 release Life is Good_a strikingly powerful album and it arrives at a strikingly key time. The sixth studio album by the renowned Celtic-punk rockers now in their 20th year is mature, well crafted, equally polished and almost aggressively topical. It is filled with rousing songs that are timeless in their sentiment, but directly related to today's most pressing concerns: politics, the economy, unemployment, planned boomtowns gone bust, immigration policies gone awry, and much more.The message is delivered and built on the backs of boisterous and barreling live touring. ""We're known for our live shows,"" says singer and lyricist, Dave King. ""Writing albums has always been a vehicle for us_it_s been a means to get people onto the dance floor. And that's kind of the way we've always approached it, no matter what. The one thing we are is a positive band,"" adds King. ""When people come and see our shows, it's a celebration_of life, of the good and of the bad. And we have to take the good and the bad for it to be a life.""","Live musicLive music",7:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,15.02.2019,15.02.2019,No,"3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.110160-115.174040,https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/entertainment/events/flogging-molly,702 698 6797
Cosmopolitan _5.jpg,The Revivalists,"A remarkable thing happened to The Revivalists as they came upon their tenth anniversary as a band. The New Orleans-based septet scored a game-changing hit with _Wish I Knew You,_ a wistful song from their third album, Men Amongst Mountains. Guided by dynamic percussion and punchy horns, the single features a contagious hook and feel-good chorus that has resonated with fans across all different genres. Though the album was released in July of 2015 (debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard Alternative Albums chart), the band's break out single ""Wish I Knew You"" has a rare and undeniable staying power.Comprised of acclaimed musicians David Shaw (lead vocals/guitar), Zack Feinberg (guitar), Andrew Campanelli (drums), George Gekas (bass), Ed Williams (pedal steel guitar), Rob Ingraham (saxophone), Michael Girardot (keyboard & trumpet), The Revivalists are recognized as an extraordinary live band. And while _Wish I Knew You_ has had a seismic effect on their career, The Revivalists_ relentless touring over the past several years has played a major part in getting them to this point.The band has sold-out headlining tours in 2015, 2016, and 2017, and performed sets at such marquee festivals as Bonnaroo, Governor_s Ball, Outside Lands, and Austin City Limits. This past year they were invited to perform on the main stage at New Orleans_ Jazz Fest (after six years playing the second stage) for 40,000 people, attracted 5,000 fans to their show at Central Park_s SummerStage in New York City, and visited cities like Toronto for the first time playing to packed houses.","Live musicLive music",7:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,16.03.2019,16.03.2019,No,"3708 Las Vegas Boulevard South, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.110160-115.174040,https://www.cosmopolitanlasvegas.com/entertainment/events/the-revivalists,702 698 6797
