Signature menu selections include the bacon-wrapped Backyard BBQ Dog, Blue Cheese Burger with Shock Top caramelized onions, St. Louis Style Spare Ribs and more. For those with a sweet tooth, concession carts offer ice cream with a HEXX Chocolate _Magic Shell,_ cotton candy and blueberry pie, among other options.LAS VEGAS ROOFTOP BAR & GRILLThe open-air park has an atmosphere combining the feel of a classic baseball stadium and the communal charm of a city park with the spirit of Budweiser; a nostalgic combination that evokes Americana charm. The space was designed to bring people together through various seating experiences, including communal picnic tables that encourage socializing and a grassy lawn to play classic bar games like giant Jenga, pool, and darts.
