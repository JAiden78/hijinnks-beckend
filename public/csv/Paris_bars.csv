Paris_10.jpg,Martorano'S,"The homestyle cuisine at this Italian Las Vegas restaurant gets kicked up a notch thanks to the edgy attitude of Steve Martorano. The tough-talking, South Philadelphia-bred chef infuses his own East Coast upbringing into the old-school flavorings of his food, giving it a more authentic, family recipe taste. (Think rigatoni with Sunay pork gravy and South Philly cheesesteak.)Though he famously forbids substitutions to his dishes, you'll find that traditional favorites such as penne alla vodka and linguine in white clam sauce are tasty enough just as they are. The large plate portions pair well with specialty cocktails and a lengthy wine list, including his own wine label.Located along the property's Le Boulevard shopping and dining corridor, the large space features a bar, lounge and dining room serving dinner and lunch. The restaurant's design is influenced by the original location that Martorano (aka the ""Godfather of Italian American Cooking"") first opened in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. WHAT TO EAT AT THIS ITALIAN RESTAURANTEggplant stackHomemade mozzarellaWorld Famous Meatball with gravy and ricotta cheeseBucatini carbonaraEXPERT TIPSWatch out for celebrities dining next to you. Setting a scene perfectly in sync with classic Vegas, old films such as ""Casino"" are shown in between tunes by Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and Bobby Darin.As the night gets later, music segues into a party mix of classic R&B, disco, slow jams and a bit of classic rock.Try the cocktails with a scoop of water ice (a Philly favorite) for a frozen treat.",Bars & Lounges,5:00:00 PM,10:30:00 PM,11.01.2019,31.12.2019,Everyday,"3655 Las Vegas Boulevard South Las Vegas , NV 89109","36.112385, -115.171486",https://www.caesars.com/paris-las-vegas/restaurants/martorano,702 731 7778
