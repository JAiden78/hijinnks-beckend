Linq_28.jpg,The Green At Brooklyn Bowl,"Since forming on O'ahu, Hawai'i, in 2009, The Green has become one of the most successful and beloved bands in the reggae genre. During their relatively short career, the band has been awarded a Best Reggae Album nod from iTunes (2010, for their self-titled debut), four coveted Na Hoku Hanohano awards in their native Hawai'i (2011 and 2014, including Group of the Year, two different Reggae Albums of the Year and Entertainer of the Year), and two #1 Billboard Reggae chart debuts, along with charting on the Billboard Top 200. Not bad for a band that was formed by six members of Hawai'i's tight-knit music scene to record a few songs and have some fun.The Green was one of the first Hawaiian reggae bands to tour extensively on the mainland, as well as going further afield to New Zealand, Japan and other locales. Before becoming a headliner on their own, the band supported bands like Bruno Mars, Rebelution, Michael Franti, Iration, SOJA, and Damian Marley, as well as performed at acclaimed festivals including Vans Warped Tour, Wakarusa, Sierra Nevada World Music Festival, and California Roots Festival.The Green's fourth studio album, Marching Orders, comes out October 20, via longtime label partner Easy Star Records. It continues the group's steady march to the top ranks of their genre and beyond, with early reviews already calling it ""innovative"" and ""imaginative."" The Green has a winter headlining tour lined up and recently announced covering much of the U.S., with further touring plans expected to be announced for a busy 2018.",Live music,8:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,17.01.2019,17.01.2019,NO,"3535 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.118412, -115.171347",https://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/1799669-green-las-vegas/,702 862 2695

Linq_31.jpg,Kottonmouth Kings At Brooklyn Bowl,"Self described hip-hop/punk rock band from Placentia, California. Initially known as The P-Town Ballers and then Cottonmouth until settling on Kottonmouth Kings. The group started with high school friends Steve Thronson (Saint Dog), Dustin Miller (D-Loc), and Timothy McNutt (Johnny Richter) hanging out and rapping songs on the radio while smoking weed. Brad Xavier (Daddy X), who was known for being in local punk band Humble Gods at the time, took notice of their skills and suggested they start a rap group. Johnny Richter had legal issues, so the initial Kottonmouth Kings lineup solidified as Daddy X, D-Loc, and Saint Dog along with break dancer Pakelika and DJ Bobby B and signed with Capitol Records. At the same time they started their own label, Suburban Noize Records, to release independent music acts. After their first major full length, Royal Highness, Saint left the band due to creative differences. In 2010, Dirtball, a rapper with multiple albums released under Suburban Noize officially joined and breakdancer Pakelika was let go. Pakelika later died from complications of asthma in 2012. In 2014, there was a legal dispute between Daddy X and manager Kevin Zinger which led to the Kings leaving Suburban Noize and starting another independent label, United Family. At that time DJ Bobby B was let go from the band and Johnny Richter decided to leave. The new venture was short lived as they only released one full length and one greatest hits album before the band decided to stop touring and go on hiatus, essentially disbanding in that version. Kottonmouth Kings came back in 2018, when the original founding members D-Loc and Johnny Richter, along with Saint Dog on multiple features, released the album Kingdom Come. Current line-up features rappers/MCs D-Loc and Johnny Richter and DJ Product 1969.",Live music,8:00:00 PM,11:00:00 PM,26.01.2019,26.01.2019,NO,"3535 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.118412, -115.171347",https://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/1799669-green-las-vegas/,702 862 2695

Linq_41.jpg,Lettuce At Brooklyn Bowl,"Known for their incendiary live shows, extensive touring, die-hard fans, and massive two-decade career, Lettucehave brought a new vitality to classic funk, matching their smooth and soulful grooves with a hip-hop-inspiredurgency. Their latest offering, Witches Stew [Lettuce Records] is a contemporary jazz fusion album that pays tributeto the late Miles Davis, one of Lettuce's biggest and most beloved influences. An interpretive take on the historicallyexperimental and lauded Bitches Brew era, Witches Stew is a collection of seven songs, handpicked by the band andwas recorded at the 2016 Catskill Chill in Lakewood, PA. Released on Halloween Day 2017, the EP brings forth aneerie, ethereal, and psychedelic reimagining to what was one of the most impactful periods in Miles_ legacy, furtherdistinguishing the band for their technical mastery and improvisational, rhythmic genius.To further pay tribute to their hero, Lettuce released the first single from the EP ""Shhh / Peaceful"" on the26th anniversary of Miles' passing. Keeping tempo with steady percussion, the track features an otherworldlysound which is echoed by distant horns and tranquil guitar riffs. As a whole the album seamlessly floats from trackto track, almost as if telling a story in a language unique to each listener. Taking cue from Miles himself, the brassycrooning of the trumpet threads together each song into a cohesive body of work and brings the listener on ajourney that only Lettuce could navigate.Comprised of a stellar group musicians - Drummer Adam Deitch, guitarist Adam Smirnoff, bassist Erick ""Jesus""Coomes, keyboardist and vocalist Nigel Hall, saxophonist Ryan Zoidis, and trumpet player Eric _Benny_ Bloom - themembers of Lettuce are highly sought after musicians who, together, continue to earn their name as masters oftheir craft. Blending together these talents in a sound distinctly their own, they have garnered praised by the likesof New York Times, NPR, Billboard, Consequence of Sound, Relix, Red Bull Music and more.According to the band, it is a sense of unity and togetherness that has much to do with the camaraderie that_s onlyintensified over the lifespan of the band. Formed in 1992, when several band members attended a summerprogram at Boston_s Berklee College of Music as teenagers, Lettuce was founded on a shared love of legendary funkartists like Earth, Wind & Fire and Tower of Power. After returning to Berklee as undergrads in 1994, Lettucestarted playing in local clubs and steadily built up a following that soon extended to cities across the country andthen throughout the world. Releasing their studio debut Outta Here in 2002, its follow-up Rage! in 2009, Fly in2012, Crush in 2015 and Mt. Crushmore EP in 2016, the band has dedicated their time to balancing their prolifictouring with involvement in a host of other musical endeavors.In recent years, Lettuce have watched their fanbase expand as they_ve hit bigger and bigger stages. Selling outshows across the country, they have truly earned their name as a can_t-miss live act. As bass player Erick _Jesus_Coomes puts it, _some of these shows we_ve played over the past couple years have been so amazing, it_s like yougo home a different person._The band is currently spreading their sonic hijinks and soulful vibrations across the country on their Beyond theClouds 2018 headline tour. Comprised of 23-dates, the tour will lead the band to their third annual Rage Rocksshow, which will take place at the historic Red Rocks Amphitheatre on Friay, June 8, 2018.

Linq_47.jpg,Steep Canyon Rangers At Brooklyn Bowl,"With OUT IN THE OPEN, Steep Canyon Rangers affirm their place as one of the most versatile bands in contemporary American music. The GRAMMY© Award-winning sextet has spent nearly two decades bending and shaping the bluegrass aesthetic, wedding it to elements of pop, country, and folk rock to create something original. OUT IN THE OPEN is the Rangers bravest excursion Thu far, transcending bluegrass while also getting closest to the genre_s true form thanks to 3x GRAMMY© Award-winning producer Joe Henry_s traditional approach toward recording.Since Steep Canyon Rangers came together in 2000, they have developed a remarkable catalogue of original music that links them to the past while also demonstrating their ambitious intent to bring string-based music into contemporary relevance.In July 2017, Steep Canyon Rangers arrived at Fidelitorium Recordings, an intimate studio facility built, owned, and operated by legendary producer Mitch Easter. The band soon discovered that their producer _ along with engineer/mixer Jason RichMon _ intended to record all six members singing and playing in a room with no overdubs. The organic process allowed SCR to work fast, tracking a dozen songs in just three-and-a-half days. Steep Canyon Rangers are easily among the hardest working bands in any genre, pulling double duty on their own and as collaborators with Steve Martin. OUT IN THE OPEN is an undeniable milestone on the Rangers ongoing creative journey.

Since then, the seminal New Orleans band has consistently pushed artistic boundaries on the road and in the studio, approaching their music with open ears and drawing inspiration as much from the sounds bubbling up from their city_s streets as they do from each other.A key part of that creative spark comes from the teamwork of Mercurio and Ellman, whose ever-evolving production and arranging skills helped usher the band into a new phase of studio work beginning with the loop-centric _Ruckus_ in 2007. A series of albums focused around specific concepts like Carnival followed, as did collaborations with guests hailing from worlds outside the one Galactic calls its own.",Live music,7:00:00 PM,10:00:00 PM,26.03.2019,26.03.2019,NO,"3535 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.118412, -115.171347",https://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/1788513-galactic-ft-erica-falls-las-vegas/,702 862 2695

Yet, listening to Cope, you also may think of none of the above. You may not think at all, but rather feel a man exposing stories that haunt his heart.He was born Clarence Greenwood, a child of the seventies, and his life journey is as singular as his art. He is the radically mashed-up product of Greenville, Mississippi; Memphis, Tennessee; Vernon, Texas; Austin, Texas; Washington, DC; and Brooklyn, New York. These locations are felt everywhere in his stories. His sounds are southern rural, big sky lonely, concrete urban, and painfully romantic.

Linq_56.jpg,Snarky Puppy At Brooklyn Bowl,"_Maybe you didn_t notice, but this is Snarky Puppy_s world, and the rest of us only live in it."" - The New York TimesThe last four years have brought dramatic changes for Snarky Puppy.After a decade of relentless touring and recording in all but complete obscurity, the Texas-bred/New York-based quasi-collective suddenly found itself held up by the press and public as one of the major figures in the jazz world. But as the category names for all three of the band_s Grammy© awards would indicate (Best R&B Performance in 2014, Best Contemporary Instrumental Album in 2016 and 2017), Snarky Puppy isn_t exactly a jazz band. It_s not a fusion band, and it_s definitely not a jam band. It_s probably best to take Nate Chinen of the New York Times_ advice, as stated in an online discussion about the group, to _take them for what they are, rather than judge them for what they_re not._Snarky Puppy is a collective of sorts with as many as 25 members in regular rotation. They each maintain busy schedules as sidemen (with such artists as Erykah Badu, Snoop Dogg, and D_Angelo), producers (for Kirk Franklin, David Crosby, and Salif Ke‹ta), and solo artists (many of whom are on the band_s indy label, GroundUP Music). At its core, the band represents the convergence of both black and white American music culture with various accents from around the world. Japan, Argentina, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Puerto Rico all have representation in the group_s membership. But more than the cultural diversity of the individual players, the defining characteristic of Snarky Puppy_s music is the joy of performing together in the perpetual push to grow creatively.",Live music,7:00:00 PM,10:00:00 PM,03.06.2019,03.06.2019,NO,"3535 Las Vegas Blvd South Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.118412, -115.171347",https://www.brooklynbowl.com/event/1793985-snarky-puppy-world-tour-2019-las-vegas/,702 862 2695
