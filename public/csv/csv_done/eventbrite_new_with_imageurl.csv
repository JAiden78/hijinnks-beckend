If you're not in the club scene, or your only interaction with the club scene is turning up for the music, you might not know the name Victor Drai. That's ok. He put his name all over something you're sure to remember -- Drai's Nightclub. It's the place in Vegas for club patrons who know the difference between upscale and just scaled up.
An elevator ride above the Cromwell, a sensual boutique hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, Drai's Nightclub continues the Cromwell's attitude of specifically-chic ambiance catering to a crowd of clever and well-off waifs. The clientele can tell that the Strip is changing and they know how small batches of craft work offer greater taste. So coming to Drai's means accepting that the club is as much a place for art as getting wasted.
They offer the usual decadence you'd expect like private jet charters and bottle service packages including ridiculously expensive champagne. But even for the average club goer the space is filled with the party favors, drinks and a giant disco ball you need to create a priceless night. And that's just inside.
When the night is warm, which is a lot of time in Vegas, the pool area is open with a view of the Strip, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio across the street, and the occasional burst of fireworks set off by someone who probably paid more for that honor than we make in a month of writing about it.
In many ways, Drai's Nightclub is like its competitors and it's cohorts -- Drai's Afterhours and Drai's Beach Club -- but thanks to the efforts of renowned creator Victor Drai and the smaller but special styling of the Cromwell, Drai's Nightclub has carved out a star-shaped space in a city almost bursting with supernovas. And with the mega performers who have hit the stage, like Iggy Azalea, the Weekend and more, Drai's Nightclub is a venue that brings the show to the party and thanks you for attendance.

Tauheed Epps (born September 12, 1977), known professionally as 2 Chainz (formerly Tity Boi), is an American rapper. Born and raised in College Park, Georgia, he initially gained recognition for being one-half of the Southern hip hop duo Playaz Circle, alongside his longtime friend and fellow rapper Earl ""Dolla Boy"" Conyers. They are perhaps best known for being signed to fellow Georgia-based rapper Ludacris' Disturbing tha Peace label, as well as their debut single ""Duffle Bag Boy"".
In February 2012, Epps signed a solo record deal with Def Jam Recordings, an imprint of Universal Music Group. The following August, he released his debut studio album Based on a T.R.U. Story, to mixed reviews.[4] The album spawned three successful singles: ""No Lie,"" ""Birthday Song,"" and ""I'm Different"", all of which charted in the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 and were certified Gold or higher by the RIAA, along with the album being certified Gold. His second studio album B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time was released on September 11, 2013. It was supported by the singles ""Feds Watching"" and ""Used 2"".
In late 2012, Epps stated once he completed the B.O.A.T.S. concert tour, he will head back into the studio. In November 2012, he revealed he was three songs deep into his second studio album. The album's estimated release date was April 2013. The rapper made a guest appearance on NBC's Law & Order: Special Victims Unit in an episode that aired May 8, 2013. He also appeared as himself in the second season (episode 16) of the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls, where he travels on the same private planes as the two main characters.[33] On May 23, 2013, he announced that his second studio album B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time will be released on September 10, 2013. On June 2, 2013, Epps premiered the first single from the album, ""Feds Watching"" at the Hot 97's Summer Jam. The song features Pharrell Williams and was recorded on 2013 Grammy Awards night.[35][36] On June 15, Epps announced the title of his second album would be B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time.The album was released through Def Jam Recordings, on September 10, 2013.
B.O.A.T.S. II: Me Time featured guest appearances from Pharrell Williams, Fergie, Drake, Lil Wayne, Pusha T, Mase, Chrisette Michele, Iamsu!, T-Pain, Dolla Boy, Rich Homie Quan, and Lloyd among others. The album's production was handled by Diplo, Mike WiLL Made It, Drumma Boy, J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, Mannie Fresh, Wonder Arillo, Da Honorable C-Note and DJ Toomp among others. It was also supported by the single ""Used 2"", along with the promotional singles ""Where U Been?"" and ""Netflix"". Upon the album's release, it was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. It also faired decently commercially, debuting at number three on the US Billboard 200, and number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart selling 63,000 copies in its first week.
On October 23, 2013, Epps revealed that he had begun working on his third studio album immediately following the release of B.O.A.T.S. II. He also stated he had the first single from his third album ready for release and that he still wanted to get Jay-Zfeatured on the album.[42] In November 2015, 2 Chainz revealed that we was releasing a joint album with Lil Wayne, titled ColleGrove.[43] On May 5, 2014, Epps released a brand new EP titled FreeBase for free digital download. It includes 7 songs, and includes features from Lil Boosie, A$AP Rocky, Rick Ross and more. The EP has earned over 200,000 downloads. In January 2014 Epps released a promotional single ""I'm A Dog"".

Drai's Nightclub - a multilevel indoor/outdoor club that makes you feel like a VIP while providing stunning views of the stars and the Las Vegas Strip.
Located in The Cromwell Las Vegas (formerly Barbary Coast and Bill's Gamblin' Hall and Saloon[1]) - a luxury boutique hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip in Paradise, Nevada. It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation.
If you want a true nightclub experience that still speaks to the boutique mentality of the too-cool-for-everything millennium, try Drai's Nightclub. Then go to Drai's Afterhours. The contrast makes them both cooler. In 1997, Victor Drai opened Drais restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip.[14] Two years later, Drai added a nightclub to the restaurant, re-branding it Drais After Hours.[15] In Vegas Seven's 2012 Nightclub Awards, Drai's After Hours won ""Best Place to Disappear"".[16][17] It is still located in the Cromwell Hotel and opens after Drai's Beach Club Nightclub closes.
RSVP for Drais Rooftop Nightclub ASAP!!

Drai's Beachclub is perched 11 stories above the Las Vegas Strip on the rooftop of The Cromwell. And its view is exactly as spectacular as you'd expect from that locale. You're safe from falling over the edge thanks to tall glass -- or probably some sort of plastic -- walls. But your sights are far from restricted. When you eventually turn back to the pool club itself, and quit pretending that all the people walking in front of Caesars are just ants waiting for you to judge them with your godly wrath, you'll see the true beauty of Drai's Beachclub.
The space has large pools that are slightly elevated so you have to step into them, which is a nice addition for anyone who's ever set the phone or purse next to the pool only to have it fall in five seconds later. And the palm trees around the pools give just enough shade to make you feel like you're swimming it someplace sort of secret, even though everyone can totally see you.
When you're renting a cabana, you can go high or low. Take a daybed by the edge to get views of the Strip, or go for the second-level cabanas to gaze over everyone in the pool. Either way you get VIP service and an amazing view. And when you can't take the sun anymore and need to experience a cool place, there's a small bar in one corner that's always nice and chill.
Drai's Beachclub, like the connected Drai's Nightclub, gets some of the top DJs and musical performers in the world. We won't even begin to try to list them, but you can always find top quality music and shows at Drai's. Whether you want to lay out by yourself, people watch and people splash or stare down at the Bellagio Fountains and pretend they're dancing just for your amusement (are we the only megalomaniacal ones who do stuff like that?), Drai's Beachclub is an exceptional club among the already incredible Drai's family.",https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F42968776%2F223526219891%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C302%2C900%2C450&s=2bbb5ab94a5bd1dd8b84945146887ee2,,PST,4/8/2018 11:00,"(36.115049, -115.172144)"

DJ Scooter
Scooter started DJing because of his love and passion for music. That passion soon turned into a full-time career. Scooters signature vibrant style is a genre-bending, mind-blowing mix that always is fresh and exciting. Unlike other DJs who jump on house or hip hop as they come in and out of popularity, Scooter has mastered both hip hop and house and has been producing house music for over fifteen years. He is one of the few DJs who can spin for a hip hop crowd and the next night play for an electronic crowd, rockin both parties easily and with amazing prowess.

His unparalleled talent and technical skills on the turntables has allowed him to perform in nearly every state in the United States. Scooter has not only established himself as a renowned DJ nationwide, but internationally as well. He has traveled and performed in the Dominican Republic, China, Korea, France, Mexico, Canada, Argentina, and Guatemala, just to name a few.

Other DJs may play music, but what sets Scooter apart is his innate ability to read and rock any crowd. If the people arent happy and loving the music, Im not doing my job, claims Scooter. Regardless of the venue or event, he always chooses the music that will not only rock the crowd at hand, but leave them with an unforgettable party experience.

He has an infectious enthusiasm when he is rockin the decks. In the midst of a jam, he can be seen jumping up and down, pumping his fists, and yelling on the mic for everyone to throw their hands in the air! In a nutshell, Scooters performances are full of non-stop energy.

One half of the dynamic duo, Scooter and Lavelle, Scooters hip hop loops and turntable skills are combined with Lavelles banging progressive mixes to bring audiences an explosive performance. Scooter has also established himself as an accomplished producer, scoring a Top Ten hit on XM Radio with Scooter and Lavelles Beats Inside My Head. He has also been retained to create music for WWF and Bravo TV.

A phenomenal DJ as well as an accomplished producer, DJ Scooter does it all. He continues to provide the best in night life entertainment around the globe!

HIGHLIGHTS FROM HIS CAREER:

Scooter and Lavelles Beats Inside My Head track made the Top 10 XM Radio List and Beatports Top Download List
Shared the stage with greats like Busta Rhymes, Lil Wayne, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Tiesto, Paul Oakenfold, Donald Glaude, Deadmau5, and Deep Dish
Original resident DJ of the legendary Rehab Pool Party at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas with Lavelle Dupree
Residencies at Vessel in San Francisco, the Liquid Pool Lounge in Las Vegas, Haze at the Aria in Las Vegas, 1Oak in New York City, and Greystone Manor in Los Angeles

If you're not in the club scene, or your only interaction with the club scene is turning up for the music, you might not know the name Victor Drai. That's ok. He put his name all over something you're sure to remember -- Drai's Nightclub. It's the place in Vegas for club patrons who know the difference between upscale and just scaled up.
An elevator ride above the Cromwell, a sensual boutique hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, Drai's Nightclub continues the Cromwell's attitude of specifically-chic ambiance catering to a crowd of clever and well-off waifs. The clientele can tell that the Strip is changing and they know how small batches of craft work offer greater taste. So coming to Drai's means accepting that the club is as much a place for art as getting wasted.
They offer the usual decadence you'd expect like private jet charters and bottle service packages including ridiculously expensive champagne. But even for the average club goer the space is filled with the party favors, drinks and a giant disco ball you need to create a priceless night. And that's just inside.
When the night is warm, which is a lot of time in Vegas, the pool area is open with a view of the Strip, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio across the street, and the occasional burst of fireworks set off by someone who probably paid more for that honor than we make in a month of writing about it.
In many ways, Drai's Nightclub is like its competitors and it's cohorts -- Drai's Afterhours and Drai's Beach Club -- but thanks to the efforts of renowned creator Victor Drai and the smaller but special styling of the Cromwell, Drai's Nightclub has carved out a star-shaped space in a city almost bursting with supernovas. And with the mega performers who have hit the stage, like Iggy Azalea, the Weekend and more, Drai's Nightclub is a venue that brings the show to the party and thanks you for attendance.
If you want a true nightclub experience that still speaks to the boutique mentality of the too-cool-for-everything millennium, try Drai's Nightclub. Then go to Drai's Afterhours. The contrast makes them both cooler.",https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F41029016%2F223526219891%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C35%2C2400%2C1200&s=a061f7e8c32c8845ce316b33c1a46bee,,PST,4/8/2018 22:00,"(36.115049, -115.172144)"

When the night is warm, which is a lot of time in Vegas, the pool area is open with a view of the Strip, Caesar's Palace and Bellagio across the street, and the occasional burst of fireworks set off by someone who probably paid more for that honor than we make in a month of writing about it.
In many ways, Drai's Nightclub is like its competitors and it's cohorts -- Drai's Afterhours and Drai's Beach Club -- but thanks to the efforts of renowned creator Victor Drai and the smaller but special styling of the Cromwell, Drai's Nightclub has carved out a star-shaped space in a city almost bursting with supernovas. And with the mega performers who have hit the stage, like Iggy Azalea, the Weekend and more, Drai's Nightclub is a venue that brings the show to the party and thanks you for attendance.
If you want a true nightclub experience that still speaks to the boutique mentality of the too-cool-for-everything millennium, try Drai's Nightclub. Then go to Drai's Afterhours.

If you're not in the club scene, or your only interaction with the club scene is turning up for the music, you might not know the name Victor Drai. That's ok. He put his name all over something you're sure to remember -- Drai's Nightclub. It's the place in Vegas for club patrons who know the difference between upscale and just scaled up.
An elevator ride above the Cromwell, a sensual boutique hotels on the Las Vegas Strip, Drai's Nightclub continues the Cromwell's attitude of specifically-chic ambiance catering to a crowd of clever and well-off waifs. The clientele can tell that the Strip is changing and they know how small batches of craft work offer greater taste. So coming to Drai's means accepting that the club is as much a place for art as getting wasted.

Eric D-lux
Straight from the streets of Los Angeles come two of the hottest new talents in the market, Big Syphe and Eric D-Lux. This dynamic duo has been making a huge noise on both the radio airwaves and DJ circuit since joining the Power 106 family just a few short years ago. With their raw, up-beat, and straight from the streets personalities, these energetic 22 year olds have quickly become fan favorites.

Coming from humble beginnings, both began their love of music at a very young age. Influenced by older cousins and friends, each was already fully engulfed in the DJ community by their early teens. Saving up any money they could, each managed to buy records, mixers, turntables, needles, and everything else needed to start their journey. Teaching themselves by watching and listening each picked up the art very quickly.

By high school, each was fully entwined in the party scene, mixing at local house parties and clubs. One common booking at a local club led to the chance meeting of the two. Realizing each had the same ambition, drive, and hustle they instantly clicked and became partners. The two immediately got to work in the studio, dropping mix tape after mix tape and party break after party break, while continuing to DJ at all the hottest clubs in Los Angeles.

In March 2001, Syphe got hired on the Power 106 street team as did D-Lux exactly a year later in 2002. While working on the street team, they continued to stay on the mix tape and party break grind. Their infamous ""Buko Breaks"" Vol 1-3 got major play all over the country. Creating such a stir on the underground scene, in July of 2004, the two were asked to do a mix tape hosted by none other than Pamela Anderson. The mix tape gained major recognition, being talked about on major outlets such as XXL Magazine, the National Enquirer, and MTV. Soon after, Power 106 heavyweights DJ E-Man and Mr. Choc began to take notice and asked the duo to be special guest DJs on the weekend jump-off mix. Being that this was their life-long dream, the duo immediately rose to the occasion.

After 3 months of doing weekend jump-off mixes, the two were asked to start mixing live on-air, making them official Power 106 mixers. Overwhelmed with joy and excitement they jumped at the opportunity to mix live on the radio, most times coming straight from the clubs at 3, 4, or 5 am in the morning. After mixing on air for just over a month the two were asked to submit a jock air-check by the APD at the time Damien Young. Not ever wanting to be radio personalities, the two at first had no yearning to do so. But after much thought and a good chat with their long time friends and mentors DJ Vice and DJ Echo, they decided to do as requested. They turned in the air-check, the Power 106 bosses loved it, and the rest is history!",https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F41759898%2F2890519989%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C163%2C650%2C325&s=74347d318fdb1e365b78c5799702dc6c,,PST,4/8/2018 11:30,"(36.1226597, -115.1700866)"

DJ Mustard
Los Angeles native, DJ Mustard, is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after producers in the business. He has produced chart-toppinng hits for 2 Chainz (Im Different), Young Jeezy (R.I.P.) and Tyga (Rack City). Complex has also taken note, naming DJ Mustard one of their 25 New Producers To Watch Out For. While some have dubbed his signature sound as ratchet, Mustard describes his beats as undefinable. Says Mustard, I just want people to hear my music and feel good; go to the club, dance, have fun, and get home safenone of that gang-banging stuff. The New York Times has praised Mustards sound, stating its made for some of the starkest and most vibrant hip-hop of the last year or twobooming and square, like well-sequenced jabs with no need for combinations. Mustard has not only been been inspired by his native L.A., but also looks up to producers such as Dr. Dre, Swizz Beatz, and Timbaland. He is currently working on YGs upcoming album, as well as singles for Ludacris and B.o.B. He recently signed a management deal with Roc Nation.",https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F41759760%2F2890519989%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C163%2C650%2C325&s=59321af56f8688d5ad4f3b7e08d54123,,PST,4/8/2018 22:00,"(36.1094433, -115.174216)"

DJ Vice
Born and raised in Eagle Rock, DJ Vice was exposed to Power 106 during High School. Vice met Lozano one day when Power 106 came to his school during lunch. There was one kid who won every trivia question asked, It was VICE. DJ Vice has always been a big fan of the station, he listened all the time 24/7.

Mixing has always been in Vice's blood. Mixing since the 8th grade, he played dances, house parties, even a barmitzva. He once heard what he considered a horrible street team mixer and said to his friends, ""Damn, I need to be on the radio"".

DJ Vice started mixing on Power 106 in April of '97. He still recalls being 3 hours early for his mix and his hands as sweaty as Mr. Choc's forehead!!

One thing that has surprised him the most...""I never realized that I could make a living out of mixing"", Vice said. ""There are so many other things you can do, like TV"" Vice is referring to his co/host position on Nickelodeon's ""The Snick House"". That lasted nine months.

Most people would be surprised to know that DJ Vice collects and spins House, Trance, and Break Beats. Vice says, ""A lot of people are afraid to admit that, I say music is music and a DJ should be able to play anything from Joan Jett, Jay-Z to Beanie Man, anything""

DJ Vice is also known for the mix CD's he puts out worldwide every other month. He feel's radio is a very important aspect of breaking new music but the streets are just as important. Vice say's ""some records are huge in the clubs but you have never heard them played on radio there meant for the streets!!"" Be on the lookout at your local mom and pop record stores for his hop-hop and R&B mega mixes that please both radio listeners and the underground heads.

DJ Vice loves mixing because he loves music and has since he was young. It is a way for him to express himself and show what he is feeling. Listen for him during the Cali-Caliente Powermix weekends to see for yourself.",https://img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F41759792%2F2890519989%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C163%2C650%2C325&s=6199ecc7b1dae84fe87278d05ad57ca6,,PST,4/8/2018 11:00,"(36.1094433, -115.174216)"
