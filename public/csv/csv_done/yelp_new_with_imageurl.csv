PST\n\nFor VIP seating upgrades, please fill out a request on the House of Blues website.\n\nHouse of Blues Las Vegas is a carbon neutral venue by Terrapass.\n\n""The title of Steel Panther\'s third full-length album, All You Can Eat, came from a dream.""\n\n""However, it wasn\'t a dream Martin Luther King had or even any of the band members--Michael Starr [lead singer], Satchel [guitarist], Lexxi Foxx [bass], and Stix Zadinia [drums]--for that matter.""\n\n""\'Believe it or not, the title came from a fucking girl that I was fucking,\' admits Satchel. \'She fell asleep next to me on the tour bus. She woke up and told me she had a dream that we called the album, All You Can Eat. She was really hot, and she had great tits. I decided I was going to steal the title from her and not tell her. I kicked her off the bus.  She can\'t do jack shit about it. She\'s probably living in a trailer park somewhere. It\'s a great title though.\'""\n\n""More importantly, that moniker fits this rock \'n\' roll opus like a condom--not that Steel Panther practice or condone safe sex though. No, All You Can Eat is raw, raucous, and righteous heavy metal in its finest form. The Los Angeles quartet upholds the pillars of its sound. There are badass riffs aplenty, arena-size grooves, lyrics about sex, drugs, and senior citizens, and the lingering scent of whisky, a stripper\'s perfume, and hairspray. In order to capture all of this, the band began writing immediately after they got off the road behind their sophomore effort, Balls Out, their second album to debut at #1 on Billboards Comedy Albums Chart.""\n\n""\'We\'ve grown a lot,\' says Michael Starr. \'On the first record, you get a flavor of some Bon Jovi, Mtley Cre, and Def Leppard. On the second, you get a flavor of Guns N\' Roses. On this record, the main flavor is Steel Panther.\'""\n\n""Tasting the Panther, the boys retreated to Clearlake Studios with longtime producer Jay Ruston. Immediately, they got into their groove and went for it balls-to-the-wall.""\n\n""\'I do a lot of my writing while I\'m taking a shit or I\'m in the shower,\' Satchel goes in. \'I\'ll fucking jump in the shower once a week, and it happens. I write it down. Lyrics will be written on a chick\'s back while I\'m fucking her. Then, everybody does his own thing to the song--or the chick--and the song is great. The music really writes itself. You just let the Lord speak through you.\'""\n\n""With a milkman like work ethic, Steel Panther may just be the hardest working men in show business. Their formal debut Feel the Steel also hit #1 on Billboard\'s Top Comedy Albums Chart. They\'ve sold out shows worldwide from Australian to the UK\'s iconic Brixton Academy, as well as appearing on festivals such as Download and Rock on the Range. Historical milestones include being the oldest heavy metal band to snag a major label deal and the only band to consistently play weekly on the Sunset Strip for an unprecedented thirteen years straight. Moreover, rock luminaries ranging from Aerosmith\'s Steven Tyler and KISS\'s Paul Stanley to Slipknot\'s Corey Taylor, Linkin Park\'s Chester Bennington, and Rage Against the Machine\'s Tom Morello have all partied with the Panther on stage. Meanwhile, this fearsome foursome has also appeared on Dancing With the Stars, Bad Girl\'s Club and a web campaign for the big screen adaptation of Rock of Ages.""\n\n""Ultimately though, they\'re not stopping anytime soon. \'Our drive to bring heavy metal back has not lessened,\' concludes Michael Starr. \'It\'s actually gotten stronger.
