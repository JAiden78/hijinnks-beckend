Aria_U.jpg,Liquid Poo Lounge,"Located on the promenade level at ARIA, this 215,000-square-foot pool area is reminiscent of a lagoon. 
With all the palm trees and foliage (including bright pink and white flowers in oval-shaped flower pots) and a stone waterfall fixture, visitors are truly whisked off to paradise. And since the three oval-shaped pools are spread out in the spacious complex, it never feels crowded. The music and overall energy of the pool area are upbeat, but the atmosphere keeps it at a relaxing pace. For guests who want to meander from one pool to the other, there are shaded walkways to make the summer heat more bearable. 
There are plenty of beach chairs scattered around the three pools. Guests can also relax in one of the three whirlpools. For those who worked up an appetite, Breeze Caf‚ offers a full menu and shaded seating outdoors. There is also a separate bar area where visitors can kick back and relax. 
For the ultimate pool day, there are 35 cabanas, each with its own refreshing misters. Those renting one also have complimentary use of a pool raft. The pool at ARIA also features two mega-sized cabanas that can fit up to10 guests. These spacious cabanas look like fully-furnished, apartment-style living rooms. Both cabanas come with a 42-inch flat-screen TV, a sectional couch and even a six-seat dining table with playing cards. Cabana servers can even bring food from the caf‚ over to the dining table. 
For more of a club-type atmosphere, Liquid Pool Lounge is located just next door. Guests can enjoy hip-hop, Top 40 and dance music. 
The pool at ARIA is located right next to the spa entrance. Hotel guests have easy access to the pool and don't have to worry about trekking through the casino -- it's just a quick elevator trip and walk away.
