Wynn_22.jpg,Kygo At Xs,"The club designers at Wynn/Encore have created a club that works on all levels of extravagance and practicality. From the moment you queue up in small rooms adjacent to the club, instead of loitering in the middle of the hall with all the poor souls who can't get in or are too turned off by the crowds, it's clear that XS is doing something different than the clubs of the past. And the moment you see the golden adornments of women set into the walls and the lights that make the full moon jealous, you'll know your night has become something to remember. Just don't walk up and paw the alcove ladies. You're trying to be classy after all.Aside from the obviously expensive surroundings, the design of XS, modeled after the best parts of its closed older sister Tryst, is a reason in itself to attend. Even if the carpet were cheap and the d_cor something substantially less than golden-goddess chic, the centrally-located dance floor surrounded by accessible tables, wide walking spaces and enough room at the bar to actually get a drink and pivot in place without stepping on someone make XS the club for flow and poise. And that mentality extends into the outside pool area.Behind the DJ booth is the outdoor pool. The lights and sound system are designed to ensure that those enjoying the night air have the same experience as those who prefer to stay inside. Massive lighting systems with lasers and screens are mounted around the club's poolside entrance. And an extremely private -- as in restricted pretty much to talent and the people they're sleeping with -- VVVIP area is right behind the DJ booth. If you can get there, without having to trade your innocence or sense of shame, it's quite possibly the best club seat in Vegas.XS sees an astounding amount of people throughout the week, so expect it to be busy. And it's easy to see why. Expanding on the success of Tryst, XS has become one of the top performance spots in Vegas. The details of the experience are what set this club apart. Some places talk about their fine quality leather. Some are obsessed with putting their most expensive drinks on the forefront of people's minds, just so they can say they have them. But XS is about the space, the patrons and the night you'll have. They've put a sincerely ridiculous amount of time, energy, knowledge and money into it -- so much care that it borders on XS-ive. But it's all totally worth it. For a club that learns from its competitors and its collaborators, then steps up its game, XS is just the right amount of awesome.",Nightlife & Nightclubs,10:30:00 PM,4:00:00 AM,11.01.2019,11.01.2019,No,"3145 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.093391-115.173027,http://www.intriguevegas.com/calendar,702 770 2040
