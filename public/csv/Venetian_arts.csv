LOVE is about being free to love who you want, the way you want,_ said artist Laura Kimpton. _The bird stamps in the letters represent being able to follow your dreams, which is the message that I hope will inspire people as they interact with the piece. Las Vegas is the city where people pursue their dreams, and this sculpture will act as a touchstone for this pursuit._",Arts & Crafts,12:00:00 AM,12:59:00 PM,11.01.2019,31.12.2019,Everyday,"3355 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.122967, -115.170215",https://www.venetian.com/resort/explore-the-venetian/art-and-architecture/love.html,866 659 9643
Venetian_58.jpg,Discover The Spirit Of Venice,"A Journey Filled With Venetian Culture and HistoryThe Venetian and The Palazzo Las Vegas are celebrating the quintessential symbol of Venice with a new seasonal display that features one of the world's oldest Venetian gondolas. The historic gondola, thought to be constructed around 1850, is considered by experts to be one of the best surviving examples of Venetian gondolas from that time period. The impressive specimen spans 36 feet and is nearly 5 feet wide. The only other historic Venetian gondola on display in the United States is at the Maritime Museum in Newport News, Virginia.To commemorate the artifact's arrival to the resort, the gondola is presented among a magnificent floral display in the atrium gardens. After the seasonal display concludes, the gondola will return to the resort's archives until a future display location can be determined. Each year more than half a million guests experience a gondola ride at The Venetian Las Vegas on one of the resort_s replica gondolas. The Venetian pays tribute to the Floating City with its gondola experience, giving visitors the opportunity to float down the Grand Canal.

Venetian_59.jpg,Renaissance Venice in Las Vegas,"Founded in 421 A.D., Venice grew to become the center of a maritime republic and one of most influential cultural cities in the Mediterranean world. In a brash move to proclaim Venice_s arrival as a city on par with Rome, two Venetian merchants stole the relics of St. Mark the Evangelist from Alexandria in 828 A.D. The relics were received with great ceremony and housed in the newly built Basilica of San Marco in 832. With that, St. Mark had replaced St. Theodore as the patron saint of Venice. By the 16th century, Venice had colonized all of northeastern Italy and held a monopoly over Mediterranean trade.",Arts & Crafts,12:00:00 AM,12:59:00 PM,11.01.2019,31.12.2019,Everyday,"3355 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109","36.122967, -115.170215",https://www.venetian.com/resort/explore-the-venetian/art-and-architecture/love.html,866 659 9643

Venetian_62.jpg,The Campanile Tower at The Venetian,"Perhaps the most iconic of all the landmarks of The Venetian Las Vegas, the Campanile Tower has a long and glorious history.

It was primarily used as a lighthouse for the docks near the Piazzetta. The Campanile Tower was finally completed in the 12th century, at which time the logetta was added to the base of the structure.Throughout the intervening centuries, the Campanile Tower was rebuilt several times due to earthquakes or other disasters.
