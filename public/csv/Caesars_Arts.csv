Caesers_29.jpg,Carnevale Gallery,"Carnevale Gallery is pleased to announce the addition of fine art landscape photographer Patrick Di Fruscia.Gallery curator Tony Carnevale said _Patrick's work is amazing with acute attention to detail. He has proven time and again his boundaries are without limitation as he travels the world in quest for manifesting some the worlds unique and pensive landscapes through his lens. Patrick has limited his edition sizes to 20 and this has tremendous appeal for me. Being able to offer our collectors fine art photography that is limited and engaging is exactly what the Carnevale Gallery represents.",Arts & Crafts,10:00:00 AM,11:00:00 PM,01.01.2019,31.12.2019,Everyday,"3500 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109",36.117453-115.176688,http://www.carnevalegallery.com,702 812 2706
